<p>I was having an issue where configurations I was trying to apply to a program where not being applied by
  home-manager.</p>
<p>Removing the program declaration from nix-os fixed the issue.</p>
<p>It seems the nix-os version of the program was taking precendent over the home-manager version and not the other way
  around.</p>
<p>There is likely another way of doing things that allow the two versions to coexist.</p>
<p>Feel free to send me an email with the solution if ever you find it and I will update this note.</p>
