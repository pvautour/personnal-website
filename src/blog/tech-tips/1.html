# fix-ssl-validation-aws-cli.md

if you are getting the following error:

```BASH
SSL validation failed for https://cloudformation.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/ [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1010)
```

You need to add your organisations certificate to your aws config.

To do so, export it as crt and add it's path to `.aws/config` with the `ca_bundle` variable:

```config
[default]
output=table
region=ca-central-1
ca_bundle=/path/to/<your-certificate>.crt
```

## For those on windows

This was affecting me using WSL with aws cli v2. 

On windows, you can find your company certificate and export it using `certmgr.msc`.
